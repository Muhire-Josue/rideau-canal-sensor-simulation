# Rideau Canal Sensor Simulation

IoT sensor simulator for the Rideau Canal Skateway monitoring system (CST8916 final project).

This script will simulate three IoT devices (Dow's Lake, Fifth Avenue, NAC) and send JSON readings to Azure IoT Hub.

Detailed setup, configuration, and usage instructions will be added after the implementation is complete.
